= SimpleSpamPrevent

SimpleSpamPrevent is a gem for preventing spams from logged in users.

Their are many gems available to show captcha but they dont help us when a user is logged in. You can configure each rails action to a limit 'x' in 'y' seconds. So if a user is logged in and he hits the same page more than 'x' number of times in the last 'y' seconds, then he will be redirected to a page where he needs to enter captcha.
